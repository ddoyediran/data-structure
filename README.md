# Data Struture

This is to document my progress and process of learning Data Structure.

## How it works

I try to learn a concept or data type e.g Learn how `Stack` works, then try to create/ implement it and finally use this to solve related problem(s).

## How to run it

Make sure `node` and `npm` are installed. check here if not: How to [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Then `cd` to your local directory where you cloned and run "node nameOfTheFile" e.g `node stackExample.js`.
