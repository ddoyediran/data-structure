# Data Struture

This is to document my progress and process of learning Data Structure.

## How it works

I try to learn a concept or data type e.g Learn how `Stack` works, then try to create/ implement it and finally use this to solve related problem(s).

## How to run it

Make sure `node` and `npm` are installed. check here if not: How to [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
After you've installed Node, then `cd` to your local directory where you cloned and run "node nameOfTheFile" e.g `node stackExample.js`.

## I have an optimised solution "Memory and/ or Time"

If you have an optimised solution. Feel free to let me know - remember I'm doing this to learn. Simple clone, create a branch, write your solution with explanation. commit and push. I look forward to your solution. Thank you in advance üôè.
