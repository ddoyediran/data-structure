# Data Struture

This is to document my progress and process of learning Data Structure.

## How it works

I try to learn a concept or data type e.g Learn how `Stack` works, then try to create/ implement it and finally use this to solve problem(s).

## How to run it

Make sure `node` and `npm` are installed.
Then `cd` to the director where you clone and run "node nameOfTheFile" e.g `node stackExample.js`.
